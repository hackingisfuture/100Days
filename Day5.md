# 🐞 Day 5 – Bug Bounty Journey

## ✅ Highlights

- Reported **2 bugs** yesterday (forgot to mention earlier).
- Woke up with a **triaged IDOR** nice start to the day.
- Spent the morning reading blog posts until **11 AM** wasn’t feeling like hacking early on.
- Responded to a **triager** regarding an IDOR I found **2 weeks ago**:
  - The triager couldn’t reproduce the issue.
  - I shared my credentials and guided them step-by-step to reproduce the bug.
  - Hopefully, the bug will be **triaged by tomorrow**.

## 🔍 Bug Hunting Progress

- Spent **2 hours** on the same application where I had previously found **11 bugs**.
  - No new bugs today, but I plan to grind **10 more hours** on it before moving on.

## 🤝 Community Engagement

- Connected with the **Discord community** in the afternoon.
  - Helped members who had findings and needed assistance with exploitation.
  - Will follow up with them tomorrow feeling a bit exhausted today.

- Spent time with a friend who does **automation and internet-wide scanning**.
  - We're collaborating and hoping to find some bugs through automation soon.

## 🧠 Real Talk & Gratitude

- Talked to a close friend in the evening who’s going through a tough situation.
  - One of the **best bug hunters** I’ve worked with, currently inactive due to personal issues.
  - Spent **30 minutes** talking reminder: we’re not here just to make money. **Make real friends, talk to them.**

- Want to give a special **shoutout to Sharik Khan (@4non_Hunter)**.
  - During the last few months while I was around hospitals, he **reached out and helped me find doctors**.
  - Even booked a **one-on-one call with a senior doctor from AIIMS Delhi** on my behalf.
  - Without his help, I wouldn’t have found the right doctors for my family during that hard time.
  - **Thank you so much, sir. 🙏**

> If you know a fellow bug hunter going through a tough time talk to them, help if you can, and show them why the **bug bounty community is the best.**
