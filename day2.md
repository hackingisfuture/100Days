## **Day 2 of 100 Days Bug Hunting Challenge**

**Wake Up** â†’ 4:15 AM  
*(If you need video proof, let me know ðŸ˜‚)*

I started working at 4:35 AM. I usually donâ€™t wake up this early, but yesterday I slept early and I only need around 6 hours of sleep. I was just bored lying in bed, so I got up and started working. From 4:35 AM till around 8:00 AM, I worked using the Pomodoro technique (50+10 sessions).

Today, I picked a **private program** to work on and focused entirely on that for the day. Since itâ€™s the weekend, there were no blockers or customer queries for me.

This private program is quite hard and already well-tested. Even the response time for this one is over a month! But I still worked on it because I found it challenging. After spending about 3 hours in the morning, I still found **nothing**.

The web app is strict it checks every API properly, and there were no clear XSS or low-hanging fruit.

### ðŸ§  Second Session (11 AM â€“ 2 PM)

I resumed hacking from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM with 10-minute breaks in between. Around this time, I **thought I found a crazy bug** on the web app. I got so hyped and immediately started writing the report spent 30 minutes crafting the entire thing.

Then, I began recording the video PoC...  
**Guess what?**  
It turned out to be a **false positive**.

I was testing an API endpoint with the **victim's own session**, and I mistook it for an ORG takeover. Bruh ðŸ˜… 30 minutes gone for nothing.

**Lesson learned:** Always **reproduce the bug** and **record the PoC video** *before* writing the report.

### ðŸ˜´ Break + Evening Session

At 2 PM, I ate and ended up falling asleep until 5 PM.

From 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM, I gave the web app another shot and finally found a **P3â€“P4 level bug**! Iâ€™m actually proud of this one because the program is tough. For me, if I donâ€™t find any bugs in the first 45 minutes, it usually means the program is hard (talking about private ones).

### ðŸŽ‰ Night: Social Break

From 6:30 PM to 11:00 PM, I attended a friendâ€™s wedding reception, so I didnâ€™t hack during that time.

### ðŸ”§ What to Improve?

- **Clockify** â€“ I keep forgetting to hit the "start" button. I donâ€™t usually track time since Iâ€™m just deep into the flow.
- Also, I donâ€™t fully understand the concept of time tracking. Like, if you **love** doing something, why even track time?
  - But yeah... from an **ROI perspective**, it makes sense.

**See you tomorrow. Bye! ðŸ‘‹**
