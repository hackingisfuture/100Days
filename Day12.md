# Day 12 🚀

I spent most of the time writing a script (ChatGPT) and getting it into actual work. I am also trying to set up multiple VPS together. For this, I am using [hakluke/hakscale](https://github.com/hakluke/hakscale) but I am getting an **ERROR** ⚠️. Since it is a 4-year-old script, there might be some issues. Me and my friend will look into it tomorrow.

I have more than **1000 root wildcard domains** for private programs and if I am not scanning, I am doing something wrong. So I decided to spend some time learning and scripting my own **automation system** to identify vulns, quick wins, new assets, etc. It is not done yet, and I believe I have to spend consistent time on this every day. It is a never-ending process.

Other than that, I collaborated with a Discord member to report an **IDOR**. Still investigating to increase the impact.

Another member also reported an issue. I will write about it tomorrow (he is probably sleeping now 😴).

If you are reading this, please feel free to share **resources related to automation, scanning, etc.**  
Honestly, I am still figuring it out. I mostly used a single VPS before and it has been over a year since I seriously touched the terminal 💻. I stuck to **manual bug hunting** for a while, mainly using Burp Suite and browser.

---

My day mostly revolved around scripting and asking real questions to ChatGPT.

I woke up late in the morning and didn’t feel like going to the gym, but I managed to go in the evening. **Feeling proud** 💪.  
We trained **Shoulders + Arms**. Pretty solid session.

While writing this blog at `11:37 PM`, a Discord member messaged me about a **collab**. Looks promising. Let me dig deeper.

**See you tomorrow 👋**
