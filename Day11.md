# Day 11

Apologies for the delay—I was exhausted yesterday and fell asleep quickly. On Day 11, we kicked off our mornings with a gym session from 6:00 AM to 7:30 AM, as I mentioned in earlier posts. I’m prioritizing my health more, and this is a step in that direction.

We explored some valuable resources today:
- [The No BS Bug Bounty & Web Hacking Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMQq06WUMVk) – A great guide to navigate the bug bounty landscape.
- [A $2,500 Bug Bounty Write-Up: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unclaimed Node Package](https://medium.com/@p0lyxena/2-500-bug-bounty-write-up-remote-code-execution-rce-via-unclaimed-node-package-6b9108d10643) – An insightful breakdown of a high-value find.

I spent the day hunting on a public program my friend discovered. Accessing the app required multiple verifications, and she managed to get in—impressive! Since it’s a public program, many bug hunters have likely explored it, but I plan to dedicate more time to it. The app requires Indian documentation to unlock its features, which adds an interesting layer to investigate.

I also set up automation scripts and a VPS to scan my private programs, gathering subdomains and more. I’ve realized I need to allocate about 25% of my time to learning and refining automation skills to level up in this field.

Later, I assisted triagers on Bugcrowd and HackerOne with bugs I’ve submitted, contributing to the community while refining my own work.

## Off Topic

I posed a question on X ([@tabaahi_/status/1914152995828179026](https://x.com/tabaahi_/status/1914152995828179026)) about being a full-time bug hunter and marrying early—how it might impact my life, the pros and cons, and personal experiences. Many skilled bug hunters shared their insights. Some wondered why I asked, and my response is simple: because I can! This topic came up during a call with three friends, one of whom is getting married at 24-25. It sparked my curiosity, so I turned to the community for perspectives. Am I getting married? No, not yet!
