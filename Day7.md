## 🗓️ Day 7

**0 hours of hacking today.**  
Feeling very disappointed, but it was necessary. My sleep schedule was messed up, and I ended up sleeping a lot today.

### 🌅 Morning:
Woke up around **8 AM**. Spent the morning reading and watching the following for learning purposes:

- [Fuzzing WebSockets – Arete](https://arete06.com/posts/fuzzing-ws/)
- [This CTF Teaches You Everything About Hacking an API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tyqvl-GSNQ)
- [Standoff AMA session with Hussein Daher and Nikhil Shrivastava](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEBaJWDfL-k)

There was an update on my submission the triager asked for steps to reproduce and impact, etc., so I spent time rewriting the details.  
You might relate: you’ve had a bug in the “New” state for weeks, and now someone suddenly asks for more info… and you’ve forgotten how it worked.  
So again, I had to spend time understanding the app myself.

#### 🐞 Site-Wide CSRF Bug Update:
There was some internal activity by the customer for the support team.  
I believe they won’t pay me the bounty I **deserve** for that bug.

I also found a few more bugs in their web app one **IDOR** is pending, and internal activity is still going on.  
But honestly, I will never work on this program again if they don’t pay the bounty a bug hunter **deserves**.

All of this... I don’t count as actual “work.”  
**So work hours: 0.**

### 💤 Afternoon:
Mostly slept. Recovery mode.

### 🎉 Evening:
Attended a reception party, so nothing exciting or productive.

---

One thing I’m clear about: **I won’t lie to my people.**  
If I didn’t do anything today, I’ll be honest about it.

Take care :)
