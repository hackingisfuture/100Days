### Day 8

Hi everyone,
I did some hacking in the morning and reported an IDOR vulnerability, which was classified as P2. I collaborated with one of the members from my Discord server for this report. That’s all for bug hunting today.

Due to some personal reasons, I wasn’t able to focus on work from the afternoon until now. Something really bad happened (don’t worry, it’s not a health issue). I just can’t share the details.

One thing I’ve learned and you should too is that sometimes we get extremely angry, but it’s important to stay calm and speak only when necessary. Words have power. They can start wars between families, friends, or even countries.

Thanks.
