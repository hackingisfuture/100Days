## Day 14

As I mentioned yesterday, today I started my morning on a Google Meet call with a friend. We focused on understanding the target together. He has already found multiple bugs on this program, and since he knows my skillset well, we're collaborating to uncover more.

Due to other commitments during the day, I can only dedicate around 3 hours daily to this collaboration. Today, I read through all his previous findings to better understand his approach and mindset. I did two work sessions, each 90 minutes, in the morning and afternoon. Found a few leads, but no valid bugs yet.

### Automation Progress

I'm still diving deeper into automation, and it's slowly starting to pay off. Today, I found **3 bugs using automation**, which feels great. I believe the ROI will significantly increase once I master automation and apply it to every bug bounty program. Right now, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm just **1% into my automation journey**, with a long road ahead. I'm committed to learning the rest.

### Bugcrowd Update

One of my previous Bugcrowd reports just got triaged today. The client responded quickly and even rewarded a bounty within a few hours. That gave me a bit of a boost. I had only submitted one bug on that program to test their response. Looks like it's worth spending more time there. Hoping to dig deeper and find more bugs soon.

### Blog Read Today

Highly recommend this blog I read today:

### New Bug Submission Challenge

I‚Äôve also started a personal challenge and announced it in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PW9P2SFD):  
**Submit 100 bugs on bug bounty platforms before 31st May 2025.**  
Severity doesn‚Äôt matter, it's about volume and consistency. By declaring it publicly, I‚Äôve created accountability. No matter what I‚Äôm going through or how I feel, I have to keep pushing. I‚Äôll update the count daily starting tomorrow.

**Current Streak for the Challenge:**  
`0 / 100`  
**Deadline:** 31st May 2025
