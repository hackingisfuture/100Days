# 🐸 Day 6 – Sleep Messed Up, Bug Life Still On!

Yesterday I published my blog post at **10 PM** and went to bed around **11:30 PM**. But I woke up in the middle of the night to drink some water and noticed there was activity on my submission that’s been stuck in the **"New"** state for **20 days**. 

The triager still couldn't reproduce the issue. And I knew — if I didn’t respond **right now**, it could take them another 20 days. So I replied and went back to sleep at **1 AM**. Woke up again at **~5 AM** as my family wakes up for **Fajr namaz**.

At **6 AM**, I booted up my PC. A friend from my Discord server DMed me saying he found a few **IDORs** on a newly added domain and wanted me to take a look. I spent about **45 minutes** on it but didn’t find anything — the API structure was completely different and my current tooling is based on XML. Switching tools and mindset takes time.

### 🤖 Automation Update

As I mentioned earlier, I’m working on an automation script with **X-friend**. We made some progress today. Later, I also pinged **Y-friend**, but we didn’t find anything together — yet.

### 📚 Learning & Discord Drop

I spent some time this morning reading and taking notes on interesting bug bounty tweets. I’ve uploaded those notes in our Discord server. You can join here:

### 💸 CSRF Drama

Still waiting on the client who paid **$1000** for a **site-wide CSRF (P3)**. They're not responding. I reached out to support hoping they’ll help.

I reported **3 critical CSRF actions** in that report. If I had submitted them separately, it could’ve been **$1000 x 3 = $3000**. But they marked it **P3**, paid for one, and ghosted me. 🤡  
Let’s see if the support team helps me get the actual **P2** bounty.

### 🤝 Helping the Community

Got multiple DMs on Discord in the afternoon — people asking me to help reproduce their bugs or increase the impact. I co-reported **one bug** with a server member. Other reports are still in progress as I need time to push the impact level up.

Also, gave a **mini challenge** to my members today — they’re forming teams now. Told them what I used to do with my own friends during my early bug hunting days.

### 😢 One Closed as Duplicate

One of the bugs I reported **2 days ago** was closed as a **duplicate**. That one hurt.

### 🎉 Tomorrow’s Plan

I’ll be attending another friend’s **wedding reception** tomorrow. Yep — feels like **everyone’s getting married except me**, lol.

Plan is simple:
- Wake up early
- Finish all important tasks before **4 PM**
- So if you need me, reach out **before 4 PM**

### 🔧 To Fix:

- 💤 **Fix my sleep schedule** – Aim for 7 hours daily
- 🛠️ **Set up my automation server** – Extra cash flow (you’ll see this in future blogs)
- 🌐 **Monitor new domains/subdomains** – My friend is helping with this, but it’ll take some time
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Hit the gym again** – Haven’t been there for a month, time to return
- ⏰ **Work blocks & focus** – Right now it’s too scattered:
    - X-friend sends new target → **CHALLLO**
    - Y-friend finds a lead → **CHALLLO**
    - Z-friend wants help escalating → **CHALLLO**

I’ll still help everyone — but **priority** comes first.  
**Eat that frog**, guys.

### 🤔 Format Feedback?

Let me know if you like this format — a full story with context — or you just want:
- ⏱️ Time spent
- 🐞 Bugs reported

But personally, I believe time means nothing if there's no output. You spent 10 hours — cool — but **what did you do?**  
So I try to showcase:
- Why certain tasks take hours
- My approach behind finding bugs
- And how **you can replicate** the same

**IKIDO.**

**See you tomorrow!**
