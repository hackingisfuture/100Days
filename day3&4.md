# 🛡️ Day 4 – Building Together, Hunting Together

Today was a mixed bag of hustle, community love, and some unexpected wins.

---

## 🕔 Early Morning Hustle

- My day began around **5:30 AM** but I finally got out of bed by **6 AM**.
- Started off by watching this YouTube video: [How Hackers Find Vulnerabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE9I92YKnV8).
- A friend from Day 1 pinged me to start working from **11 AM to 2 PM**. But I dozed off again around **8 AM** and woke up just before **11 AM**.

## 🤝 100-Hour Bug Bounty Challenge

- Joined my friend at **11:30 AM** and we discussed our approach for a new **public program** – targeting the main domain.
- We decided to take a **100-Hour Challenge** together on this application. Super pumped for this collab!

## 🌐 Launching the Community Discord Server

- Around **11 AM**, someone from the community suggested starting a Discord server – so I set it up immediately:  
  👉 [Join The Hunt Club](https://discord.gg/MxByUgdJ)
- Shared the invite on X (Twitter), and to my surprise, **~300 people joined on Day 1**.
- This server is free **forever** – a place for bug hunters to connect, share, and grow.
- Two bug hunters were discussing a bug in the **#collab** channel and needed help. I stepped in:
  - Helped bypass **XSS** for one hunter.
  - Still working with the second one.

## 💰 Bounties & Recognition

- Even though I wasn’t feeling well, I pushed through and got some work done.
- Received a **bounty today**!
  - It was for a **site-wide CSRF** that allowed **EDIT/DELETE** on multiple features.
  - While Bugcrowd usually marks this as **P2**, the customer paid me a **P3** reward of **$1000**.
  - Hoping Bugcrowd adjusts the bounty to a **P2 ($3000)** as per severity. They’re helping me out on this.

## 🧠 Recent LHE Experiences

- In the last 30 days, I participated in **2 Live Hacking Events (LHEs)**:
  1. **First LHE** – Currently ranked **2nd**, found a solid bug, got some bounties. Still waiting on a reward for my best submission.
  2. **Second LHE** – Didn't perform well due to personal stuff (friend’s wedding, health issues), and the target wasn’t fresh.
- Honestly, it sucks not performing well in an LHE. How do you guys cope with that? Let me know.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Private vs Public Programs

- Still working on a **private program** today but no luck finding new bugs – I’ve already reported **11 valid bugs**.
- The customer has started **downgrading** my reports lately, which is super frustrating.
- Might shift to a new private program soon.

> 🧠 Community asked how I divide my time:
>
> - **70%** → Private programs = Pay the **bills**
> - **30%** → Public programs = Chase the **dreams**
>
> (Sometimes you hit a jackpot on public programs, and it’s all worth it.)

## 🙏 Wrapping Up

Thanks to everyone who checked in on me. I’m doing better than yesterday. Still have **some back and stomach pain**, but I’ll push through.

If you’ve got any questions, join the **[The Hunt Club Discord](https://discord.gg/MxByUgdJ)** and drop them in the **#questions** channel – I’ll reply when I get time.

Till the next time,  
**Stay sharp. Hunt hard.**
