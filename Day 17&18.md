Day 17/100

Due to heavy rain, thunderstorms, and a power outage yesterday, I couldn’t hunt from afternoon till night. In the morning, I managed to report only one bug.

# Day 18

Yesterday, I didn't sleep well due to no electricity and heavy rain. Woke up not feeling in a good mood to do any hacking. So, I decided to talk with my Discord members on voice chat, and we spent 3 hours learning from each other and discussing random stuff. It actually helped me gain my focus back for bug hunting. It changed my mood, and in the afternoon, I started looking for bugs again. Currently focusing more on automation, so today there is no new bug. There was a small mistake in my bash script, and I’m also focusing more on building a dataset.

In the evening, I didn’t work for 2-3 hours due to rain and thunderstorms. At the start of the day, I felt like taking a day off but still managed to get some work done and reported a bug. Not a bad day, guys :)

### Work

Someone from my Discord server reached out to me yesterday regarding something he found on his domain. I wasn’t looking at it at that moment, but today I checked and found a bug. He was not online at that moment, so I reported the bug and let him know. 

In case you want to collab with me on anything, just join my Discord server https://discord.gg/PW9P2SFD and DM me with whatever lead you have — I can exploit it further. Or if you find some cool hosts to work together on, hit me up.
