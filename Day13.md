# Day 13

I woke up around 8:30 AM today, and the best thing happened: I reported a bug within the first 90 minutes of waking up. What a great start to the day! We also fixed the automation error we were getting yesterday, and now I'm using Axiom for this. I finished setting up the VPS as well.

I've never used Axiom before, so I'm getting random errors sometimes, but I can manage. Today, I spent the entire day working on automationâ€”learning, setting things up, and improving yesterday's script. I still have many pending tasks related to automation, which I'll tackle tomorrow.

Another highlight: one of our IDORs, reported on HackerOne, got triaged today. This was a collaborative effort with a member from my Discord server.

In the afternoon, I looked into a private Bugcrowd program where a friend of mine found some leads. I'm still working on it. In the evening, I hit the gym, trained my back, and managed to hit my 120g protein intake goal (which is tough for me). I planned to do some manual hacking with a friend from 9 PM to 1 AM, but I'm still fixing some automation bugs and feeling exhausted.

I'll probably look into my friend's program during the first 90 minutes of tomorrow morning. There are many potential IDORs waiting for me.

I also learned from these resources today:

Overall, it was a good day.
