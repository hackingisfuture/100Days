# 🗓️ Day 10 – Bug Bounty Grind Log

📺 **Started my day with this video:**  
[This Tiny JS Mistake Leaked Credit Cards! – by my good friend EncodedGuy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2RH2brRaJU)  
Make sure to **subscribe to his channel** – it’s packed with value for bug hunters!

🧠 **Learning of the day:**  
Saw this brilliant 1-minute blog: [The Big Lie About Competition](https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/1913288184521507211) by Shaan Puri.  
It reminded me how staying in your lane and consistent work beats chasing others.

### 💬 Personal Note

Thanks to everyone who reached out regarding a recent incident.  
It’s something personal and not related to bug hunting or the community, so I won’t be sharing more details. Still, your kind messages mean a lot. Thank you. ❤️

### 🧪 Morning Recap

Got some collab requests on Discord – mostly about making HTML payloads XSS-ready.  
Spent time checking them out, but unfortunately, most of the bugs shared turned out to be **false positives**.  
That led to a bit of wasted time.  

✅ Before 12 PM, I still managed to squeeze in **2 hours of focused hacking**.

### 🔍 Afternoon Flow

I’m about to start working with a friend (shoutout Madam 👀) on a **feature-rich application** that’s locked behind document verification.  
Got access to some **hidden subdomains** and I’m excited to dig deeper into this target. Feels like something promising is coming up!

Also, I helped a triager resolve a **blocker** on my Bugcrowd submission related to an API key leak.  
Got it sorted. ✅

### 🧑‍💻 Automation Chat

Later, I spent around an hour with a friend learning how he set up automation.  
Dude uses **hundreds of VPS** and still pays very little – I didn’t understand half of it 😅. Just noob things.

If you’re into automation and scaling VPS setups, let’s chat!  
Drop a message on the **#general** channel on Discord. I want to learn how this whole automation thing works.

Right now, I run just **1 VPS**, but I see people using 100–500 VPS setups.  
That’s insane. If I try the same without proper knowledge, I might end up paying $3–5k/month. Gotta be careful.

That’s all for Day 10. Onward. 🚀
